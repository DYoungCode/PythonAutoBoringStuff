  1.  Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?
      Code reuse, simplicity

  2.  When does the code in a function execute: when the function is defined or when the function is called?
      When a function is called

  3.  What statement creates a function?
      def

  4.  What is the difference between a function and a function call?
      function is the set of statements that perform a specific task, calling a function is telling it to run that task

  5.  How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes are there?
      1 global scope (unless you could built-in functions like print, then there are 2)

  6.  What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?
      The local variables are destroyed

  7.  What is a return value? Can a return value be part of an expression?
      a return value is sends the output of the function back to a variable assigned to the function call.  Yes, of course
      a return value can be part of an an expression, such as, return num % 2 == 0

  8.  If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?
      None

  9.  How can you force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable?
      add 'global' before the variable name

10.  What is the data type of None?
     NoneType

11.  What does the import areallyourpetsnamederic statement do?
     import a library called areallyourpetsnamederic

12.  If you had a function named bacon() in a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
     spam.bacon()

13.  How can you prevent a program from crashing when it gets an error?
     try / except statements where you have catch for the specific error

14.  What goes in the try clause? What goes in the except clause?
     try has the code you're trying to execute, except usually has error catching

15.  Write the following program in a file named notrandomdice.py and run it. Why does each function call return the same number (code below)?
     It returned the same number because you're setting random_number = random.randint(1, 6) outside of the function.  It runs once, sets the value
     to random_number variable and then you print it 4 times.

import random
random_number = random.randint(1, 6)

def get_random_dice_roll():
    # Returns a random integer from 1 to 6
    return random_number

print(get_random_dice_roll())
print(get_random_dice_roll())
print(get_random_dice_roll())
print(get_random_dice_roll())
